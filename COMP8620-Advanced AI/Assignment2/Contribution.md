At the beginning, I thought I just need to do the agent part and some paper work. However our program can't work. So in those two weeks, I spend lots of time on reading stuffs, coding and debugging. I had to understand every details of the whole program. I organised our group members to discuss, work together, answer their questions about paper and code. I am not good at C++, which is also a challenge for me. I think I could do much better if I have one more week. Our work is not good enough. In fact, I really want to rebuild the whole thing in python, but It's too late for that, which is a pity.
