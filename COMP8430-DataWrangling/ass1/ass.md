## Question 1

## Question 2

my ANU ID is 5976992. split it into 59, 76, 99, 2.
L = {5, 20, 32, 15, 42, 55, 92, 84, 56, 42, 13, 74, 59, 76, 99, 2}

1. the median of L
sort L, get {2, 5, 13, 15, 20, 32, 42, 42, 55, 56, 59, 74, 76, 84, 92, 99}. There are 16 numbers. Therefore, the median is the average of the 8th and 9th, which is (42+52)/2 = 46.
2. the mode of L
42 appears twice. Other numbers all appear once. Therefore, the mode of L is 42.
3. the five number summary of L
Firstly, minimun is 2 and maximum is 99.
Secondly, the median is 46.
Thirdly, use the median to split L to get {2, 5, 13, 15, 20, 32, 42, 42} and {55, 56, 59, 74, 76, 84, 92, 99}. Find the median of them as Q1 and Q3. Therefore, Q1 is 17.5 and Q2 is 75. The five number summary of L is {2, 17.5, 46, 75, 99}

## Question 3
1. {14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14}, {55, 55, 55, 55, 55}, {84, 84, 84, 84, 84}
2. {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 42, 42, 42}, {55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 99, 99, 99}
3. {2, 2, 20, 20, 20}, {32, 42, 42}, {55, 55, 55, 74}, {76, 76, 99, 99}
4. {8.75, 8.75, 8.75, 8.75}, {34, 34, 34, 34}, {61, 61, 61, 61}, {87.75, 87.75, 87.75, 87.75}
